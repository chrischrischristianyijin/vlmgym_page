**Analysis of Current State:**
*   **Target (Left):** A horizontal 'Z' shape, viewed from above.
*   **Current (Right):** The object is now a 'Z' shape, but it's still oriented diagonally from top-right to bottom-left. My previous yaw correction of +35 was not enough. The pitch correction seems to have worked well, as the side faces are now visible, similar to the target.

**Plan:**
1.  The primary remaining error is the yaw. It's still rotated too much clockwise. I need to apply a counter-clockwise (positive) yaw rotation.
2.  The current angle is about -45 to -50 degrees from horizontal. The target is maybe -10 degrees from horizontal. So I need to rotate it by about 35-40 degrees counter-clockwise. Let's try another +40 degrees of yaw.

**Action:**
`('rotate', [40.0, 0.0, 0.0])`
