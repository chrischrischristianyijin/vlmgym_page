Five illegal moves! Okay, I'm clearly having trouble visualizing the valid moves. I need to be more conservative. Let's try to change the equals sign to a plus sign.

I will move a match from '6' (the horizontal bar of the equals sign) to '7' (the vertical bar of the equals sign).

```
('move', [6, 0, 7, 0])
```
