**Analysis of Current State:**
*   **Target (Left):** A horizontal 'Z' shape viewed from a slightly elevated position, showing both top (black) and side (patterned) faces.
*   **Current (Right):** The object is shaped like a chair or an 'h'. The main axis is vertical instead of horizontal. This is a 90-degree yaw error. Additionally, the perspective looks off. We're seeing it almost perfectly top-down, without the slight angle that reveals the side faces, suggesting a pitch error.

**Plan:**
1.  **Yaw Correction:** The object is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise from the target orientation. I need to rotate it 90 degrees clockwise to make its main axis horizontal. This corresponds to a negative yaw of 90 degrees.
2.  **Pitch Correction:** The target object is pitched slightly away from the camera (negative pitch), revealing the side faces. The current object appears flat. I will re-introduce a negative pitch to match the target's perspective. I'll estimate this at -30 degrees.

I will combine these two adjustments into a single action.

**Action:**
`('rotate', [-90.0, -30.0, 0.0])`
