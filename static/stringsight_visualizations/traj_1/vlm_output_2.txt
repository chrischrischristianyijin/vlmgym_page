**Analysis of Current State:**
*   **Target (Left):** The object is in a horizontal 'Z' configuration, viewed slightly from above. The top faces are black, and the side faces have a triangular pattern.
*   **Current (Right):** After my last rotation, the object is in a vertical 'S' configuration. I wanted to make it horizontal, but my yaw rotation made it more vertical. This means I rotated in the wrong direction. The shape went from a top-left to bottom-right diagonal to a more vertical orientation. I need to reverse this and go further in the opposite direction. I applied -45 yaw, so to undo it and apply the correct rotation, I need to apply a positive yaw. A rotation of +90 degrees seems appropriate to turn the vertical 'S' into a horizontal 'Z'.

**Plan:**
1.  The most significant remaining error is the yaw rotation. The object is oriented vertically instead of horizontally.
