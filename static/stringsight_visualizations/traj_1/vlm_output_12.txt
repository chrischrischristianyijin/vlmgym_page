**Analysis of Current State:**
*   **Target (Left):** The target object is a Z-shape.
*   **Current (Right):** The current object is also a Z-shape. The orientation is extremely close now.

**Comparison:**
*   **Yaw:** The current object's main axis is slightly more horizontal than the target's. The target is tilted a tiny bit more clockwise. I might need a very small negative yaw (-5 degrees).
*   **Pitch:** The perspective seems almost identical. The amount of side-face visible is very similar.
*   **Roll:** The roll seems perfect.

The alignment is very good, likely within the 10-degree success threshold. I'll make one final, small adjustment to the yaw and then stop.

**Plan:**
1.  Apply a tiny clockwise (negative) yaw to match the slight downward tilt of the target's right side.
2.  I estimate this to be around -5 degrees.
3.  Then I will submit.

**Action:**
`('rotate', [-5.0, 0.0, 0.0])`
