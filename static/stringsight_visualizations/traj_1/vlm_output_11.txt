**Analysis of Current State:**
*   **Target (Left):** A horizontal 'Z' shape. More specifically, the line connecting the two ends is almost horizontal, tilted slightly clockwise.
*   **Current (Right):** The -90 degree roll was very effective. The object is now a clearly recognizable 'Z' shape. The pitch and roll seem very close to the target. The main difference is the yaw. The line connecting the two ends of the current object is tilted counter-clockwise by about 15-20 degrees. I need to rotate it clockwise.

**Plan:**
1.  The alignment is very close. The only significant remaining error is a small yaw rotation.
2.  I need to rotate the object clockwise (negative yaw) to make the overall shape more horizontal and match the target's slight clockwise tilt.
3.  I estimate the required rotation to be about -20 degrees.

**Action:**
`('rotate', [-20.0, 0.0, 0.0])`
