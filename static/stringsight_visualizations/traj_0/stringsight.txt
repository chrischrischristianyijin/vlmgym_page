Reason:
The model repeatedly issues the same swap command between the same two pieces without making any progress towards solving the puzzle, as evidenced by identical actions over multiple consecutive steps.
Evidence:
"('swap', ((0, 0), (0, 1)))" is issued in steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, with no change in strategy or progress.
