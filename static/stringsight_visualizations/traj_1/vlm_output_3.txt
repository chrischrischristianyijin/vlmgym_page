**Analysis of Current State:**
*   **Target (Left):** A Z-like shape, viewed from above and slightly to the side. The top surfaces are black.
*   **Current (Right):** The object is now a sideways T-shape. The overall structure is rotated incorrectly. It seems my large yaw rotation was an overcorrection. More importantly, the object seems flipped. Notice how in the target, the zig-zag part forms a "Z", whereas the object I have been manipulating has been forming an "S". This usually indicates a 180-degree roll error. The object is upside down.

**Plan:**
1.  The most critical error seems to be that the object is upside down, which makes it look like a mirror image ('S' instead of 'Z') when viewed from above.
2.  I will apply a 180-degree roll to flip the object over. This should correct the fundamental shape from an 'S' to a 'Z'.
3.  After this correction, I will likely need to adjust the yaw and pitch again, but the basic shape should then match the target.

**Action:**
`('rotate', [0.0, 0.0, 180.0])`
