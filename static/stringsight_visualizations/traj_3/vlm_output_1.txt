Okay, the previous move was illegal. Let's rethink the approach. The current equation appears to be something like 01 + 23 = 4567. A simple correction could be to transform it into 1 + 1 = 2, or 1 + 0 = 1. Let's try to get 1 + 1 = 2 first. 

We need to change the zero in '0' to '1'. We can accomplish this by moving one match from '4' (which currently looks like a 4) to the '0' (making it '1').

```
('move', [4, 0, 0, 0])
```
