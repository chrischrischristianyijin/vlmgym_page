The given equation is visually represented as:

```
0 1 + 2 3 = 4 5 6 7
```

The equation seems to be aiming for a simple addition. Looking at the digits, it might currently be something like "01 + 23 = 4567", which is clearly incorrect.  A feasible starting point is to try to make this equation "1 + 1 = 2".

Let's move a match to change '0' to '1', and '2' to '1'.

```
('move', [0, 0, 2, 0])
```
