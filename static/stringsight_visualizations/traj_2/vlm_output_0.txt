I need to analyze the maze to find a path from my current position (blue circle) to the red target square.

Looking at the maze, I can see:
- I'm currently positioned in the bottom right area (blue circle)
- The red target is in the top left corner
- There are gray walls and white paths
- I need to navigate through the available white paths

From my current position, I can see there's a white path that I can move through. Let me start by moving left to begin navigating toward the target.

`('move', 2)`
