This is getting complicated, and my previous moves have clearly been leading me astray. The current object's shape is heavily distorted, looking more like `<` than the target `Z`. This indicates a significant error in an axis other than yaw, likely roll or pitch. The fundamental structure is incorrect on the screen.

Let's try to restore the Z-like structure. The current `<` shape can be thought of as a `Z` that has been rolled onto its side. To bring it upright, I need to apply a roll. Visualizing the transformation, if a horizontal 'Z' is rolled 90 degrees counter-clockwise (+90 roll), its limbs would point up and down, similar to the current `<` shape. Therefore, to reverse this, I should apply a clockwise roll (-90 degrees).

This is a significant correction, but it's aimed at restoring the basic recognizable shape, after which I can fine-tune the yaw and pitch.

**Plan:**
1.  The primary problem is that the object no longer projects as a 'Z'. It looks like it's been rolled on its side.
2.  I will apply a large clockwise roll to try and bring the 'Z' structure back into the main viewing plane.
3.  I'll use -90 degrees for this correction.

**Action:**
`('rotate', [0.0, 0.0, -90.0])`
