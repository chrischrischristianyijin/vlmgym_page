**Analysis of Current State:**
*   **Target (Left):** A horizontal 'Z' shape, viewed from above, showing the top black faces and the side patterned faces. There's a slight pitch, making us look down on it.
*   **Current (Right):** My previous yaw rotation seems to have overshot. The object is now tilted the other way, from top-right to bottom-left. It looks like a 'Z' that needs to be rotated counter-clockwise. Also, the side faces are not visible, only the black top faces. This indicates a pitch error. The object is perfectly flat to the camera, while the target has some perspective.

**Plan:**
1.  **Yaw Correction:** I rotated -45 degrees, which was an overcorrection from the previous state. I need to rotate it back counter-clockwise (positive yaw). The previous state was at ~45 degrees, the current state is at ~-45 degrees. To get to the target's slightly-off-horizontal position (let's say -10 degrees), I need to rotate by about 35 degrees counter-clockwise.
2.  **Pitch Correction:** The target is viewed from slightly above. The current object is viewed from directly above (orthographic-like view, only top faces visible). This means I need to pitch the object down (negative pitch) slightly to reveal the side faces as seen in the target. I'll estimate this at -20 degrees.

I will combine these two corrections into one action.

**Action:**
`('rotate', [35.0, -20.0, 0.0])`
