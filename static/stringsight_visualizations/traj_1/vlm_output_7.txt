**Analysis of Current State:**
*   **Target (Left):** The object forms a 'Z' that is mostly horizontal, tilted slightly down on the right. We see the top black surfaces and the side patterned surfaces.
*   **Current (Right):** My previous yaw correction overshot the target significantly. The object is now oriented vertically. The overall 'Z' shape is correct, as is the perspective (showing top and side faces), but the rotation around the vertical (yaw) axis is wrong.

**Plan:**
1.  The current object is vertical, while the target is horizontal. This represents approximately a 90-degree difference in yaw.
2.  To correct this, I need to rotate the object clockwise by about 90 degrees.
3.  I will apply a negative yaw of 90 degrees.

**Action:**
`('rotate', [-90.0, 0.0, 0.0])`
