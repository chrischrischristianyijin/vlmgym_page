Reason:
The model frequently misjudges the effect of its rotations, such as applying large yaw or roll corrections that result in the object being further from the target orientation, indicating it is not fully utilizing the visual feedback provided after each step.
Evidence:
After '('rotate', [-45.0, 0.0, 0.0])', the model observes the object is now vertical and then applies '('rotate', [90.0, 0.0, 0.0])', which overcorrects. Later, it issues '('rotate', [-90.0, 0.0, 0.0])' and then again '('rotate', [-90.0, -30.0, 0.0])', showing it is not accurately interpreting the visual state changes. The model also states, 'This is a mess,' and attempts to 'reset and reconsider,' indicating confusion about the spatial state.
