**Analysis of Current State:**
*   **Target (Left):** A Z-like shape, viewed from above, with its main axis roughly horizontal. The bottom-right leg extends to the right, and the top-left leg extends to the left.
*   **Current (Right):** The 180-degree roll was successful. The object now has the correct 'Z' configuration. However, it's oriented diagonally, from the top-left to the bottom-right. The top surfaces are black, which is correct.

**Plan:**
1.  The main remaining error is in the yaw axis. I need to rotate the object clockwise to make it horizontal.
2.  The current angle appears to be about 45 degrees off the horizontal.
3.  I will apply a clockwise (negative) yaw of approximately 45 degrees. This should align the primary axis of the object with the target.

**Action:**
`('rotate', [-45.0, 0.0, 0.0])`
