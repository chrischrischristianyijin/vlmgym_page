After '('rotate', [-45.0, 0.0, 0.0])', the model observes the object is now vertical and then applies '('rotate', [90.0, 0.0, 0.0])', which overcorrects. Later, it issues '('rotate', [-90.0, 0.0, 0.0])' and then again '('rotate', [-90.0, -30.0, 0.0])', showing it is not accurately interpreting the visual state changes. The model also states, 'This is a mess,' and attempts to 'reset and reconsider,' indicating confusion about the spatial state.
