**Analysis of Current State:**
*   **Target (Left):** A Z-shaped object viewed from a specific angle.
*   **Current (Right):** The object is now in an orientation that is visually almost identical to the target. The yaw, pitch, and roll all appear to match.

The correction in the previous step has successfully aligned the object. There are no obvious remaining rotational errors. I believe the current orientation is well within the 10-degree success threshold.

**Plan:**
Submit the current orientation as the final answer.

**Action:**
`('stop', 'stop')`
