My previous action `('rotate', [0.0, 60.0, 0.0])` has brought the object into a mostly flat orientation, viewed from above.

**Analysis of Current State:**
*   **Target (Left):** The object is in a 'Z' shape, with its main body oriented horizontally, but slightly tilted. The bottom right leg extends to the right, and the top left leg extends to the left.
*   **Current (Right):** The object is now flat, but it's oriented diagonally from the top-left to the bottom-right. It looks like a backward 'S'.

**Plan:**
1.  The primary misalignment is now in the yaw axis. I need to rotate the object clockwise to make its central axis more horizontal.
